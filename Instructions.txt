This program was written to facilitate conversion of a program written on the website 'sim8085.com' to 8085-executable opcodes.
Thus, it is meant only for converting 'sim8085.com' programs into their opcode versions, and some formatting of the input programs is still needed.

===========================================================================================

Some conventions to be followed for the input program file:

1. There must always be a space given after a comma (,).

2. The default number system followed by the program is hexadecimal, i.e, do NOT specify 'H' after any operand to indicate that it is a hexadecimal number.
Also, always use uppercase alphabets for hexadecimal numbers.

3. Labels must contain at least one lowercase alphabet, and NO special characters, NO spaces. Digits are allowed.

4. While labelling a certain line in the program, it must be in the format "label: mnemonic", i.e, first the label, then a ':', followed by a space and then the mnemonics.

5. A sample program '8-bit-addition.txt' is provided for reference. It follows all the above conventions.

===========================================================================================

How to use the program:

1. Let your mnemonic input file be 'yourfile.txt'.

2. Run the program.

3. If your file is present in the same directory as this program, just enter the name of the file: 'yourfile.txt'.
If 'yourfile.txt' is present in a different directory, specify the absolute path to 'yourfile.txt', example: 'C:\Users\user\Desktop\yourfile.txt'.

4. Enter the starting address of the program in hexadecimal, example: '6100'.
This will be the address of the first line of opcode in the program.

5. Now the program will generate a file named 'yourfile_opcode.txt' in the directory in which 'yourfile.txt' exists.
It will contain the opcode version of your mnemonics-based input program.
